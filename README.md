# Boggler 

## Known issues

There are a number of relatively easy improvements that would be nice to add to this app.

- Enforce character selection to alpha characters only
- Enforce character select to the actual dice values included with Boggle
- Treat the character 'Q' as 'Qu' to more closely simulate a real Boggle game
- Invalidate results when the game board is changed
- Upon selecting a result, highlight the word in the board above
